# note-taker-express
The following app is a note taker app designed with node.js. Once the user clicks on the "get started" button on the home page, then they will be directed to a new page that will allow them to type in a "note title" and the "note text". Once they're done typing, then the save icon is dispalyed at the top of the screen. Once the user selects to save the note, then the note title will be dispalyed on the left side of the screen.
